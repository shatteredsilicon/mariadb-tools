# `mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"}

## NAME

`mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"} - Align output
from other tools to columns.

## SYNOPSIS

### Usage

    mariadb-align-output [FILES]

`mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"} aligns output
from other tools to columns. If no FILES are specified, STDIN is read.

If a tool prints the following output,

``` bash
DATABASE TABLE   ROWS
foo      bar      100
long_db_name table  1
another  long_name 500
```

then `mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"} reprints
the output as,

``` bash
DATABASE     TABLE     ROWS
foo          bar        100
long_db_name table        1
another      long_name  500
```

## RISKS

`mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"} is mature,
proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can
pose a risk to the system and the database server. Before using this
tool, please:

-   Read the tool\'s documentation
-   Review the tool\'s known \"BUGS\"
-   Test the tool on a non-production server
-   Backup your production server and verify the backups

## DESCRIPTION

`mariadb-align-output`{.interpreted-text role="program"} reads lines and
splits them into words. It counts how many words each line has, and if
there is one number that predominates, it assumes this is the number of
words in each line. Then it discards all lines that don\'t have that
many words, and looks at the 2nd line that does. It assumes this is the
first non-header line. Based on whether each word looks numeric or not,
it decides on column alignment. Finally, it goes through and decides how
wide each column should be, and then prints them out.

This is useful for things like aligning the output of vmstat or iostat
so it is easier to read.
