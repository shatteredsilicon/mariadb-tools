==========================

NAME
====

:program:`mariadb-summary` - Summarize system information nicely.

SYNOPSIS
========

Usage
-----

::

  mariadb-summary

:program:`mariadb-summary` conveniently summarizes the status and configuration of
a database and its underlying server. It is not a tuning tool or diagnosis tool.
It produces a report that is easy to diff and can be pasted into emails without
losing the formatting. This tool works well on many types of Unix systems.

RISKS
=====

:program:`mariadb-summary` is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-summary` runs mariadb-system-summary and mariadb-database-summary together.

These tools run a large variety of commands to inspect system and MariaDB
status and configuration.

It works best when executed as a privileged user, but will also work without 
privileges, although some output might not be possible to generate without root.
