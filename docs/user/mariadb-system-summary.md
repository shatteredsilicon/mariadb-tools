# `mariadb-system-summary`{.interpreted-text role="program"}

## NAME

`mariadb-system-summary`{.interpreted-text role="program"} - Summarize
system information nicely.

## SYNOPSIS

### Usage

    mariadb-system-summary

`mariadb-system-summary`{.interpreted-text role="program"} conveniently
summarizes the status and configuration of a server. It is not a tuning
tool or diagnosis tool. It produces a report that is easy to diff and
can be pasted into emails without losing the formatting. This tool works
well on many types of Unix systems.

## RISKS

`mariadb-system-summary`{.interpreted-text role="program"} is mature,
proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can
pose a risk to the system and the database server. Before using this
tool, please:

-   Read the tool\'s documentation
-   Test the tool on a non-production server
-   Backup your production server and verify the backups

## DESCRIPTION

`mariadb-system-summary`{.interpreted-text role="program"} runs a large
variety of commands to inspect system status and configuration, saves
the output into files in a temporary directory, and then runs Unix
commands on these results to format them nicely. It works best when
executed as a privileged user, but will also work without privileges,
although some output might not be possible to generate without root.

## OUTPUT

Many of the outputs from this tool are deliberately rounded to show
their magnitude but not the exact detail. This is called fuzzy-rounding.
The idea is that it doesn\'t matter whether a particular counter is 918
or 921; such a small variation is insignificant, and only makes the
output hard to compare to other servers. Fuzzy-rounding rounds in larger
increments as the input grows. It begins by rounding to the nearest 5,
then the nearest 10, nearest 25, and then repeats by a factor of 10
larger (50, 100, 250), and so on, as the input grows.

The following is a simple report generated from a CentOS virtual
machine, broken into sections with commentary following each section.
Some long lines are reformatted for clarity when reading this
documentation as a manual page in a terminal.

This section shows the current date and time, and a synopsis of the
server and operating system.

``` bash
# Processor ##################################################
  Processors | physical = 1, cores = 0, virtual = 1, hyperthreading = no
      Speeds | 1x2510.626
      Models | 1xIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz
      Caches | 1x6144 KB
```

This section is derived from */proc/cpuinfo*.

``` bash
# Memory #####################################################
       Total | 503.2M
        Free | 29.0M
        Used | physical = 474.2M, swap allocated = 1.0M,
               swap used = 16.0k, virtual = 474.3M
     Buffers | 33.9M
      Caches | 262.6M
       Dirty | 396 kB

  Swappiness | 60
 DirtyPolicy | 40, 10
 Locator  Size  Speed    Form Factor  Type    Type Detail
 =======  ====  =====    ===========  ====    ===========
```

Information about memory is gathered from `free`. The Used statistic is
the total of the rss sizes displayed by `ps`. The Dirty statistic for
the cached value comes from */proc/meminfo*. On Linux, the swappiness
settings are gathered from `sysctl`. The final portion of this section
is a table of the DIMMs, which comes from `dmidecode`. In this example
there is no output.

``` bash
# Mounted Filesystems ########################################
  Filesystem                       Size Used Type  Opts Mountpoint
  /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00   15G  17% ext3  rw   /
  /dev/sda1                         99M  13% ext3  rw   /boot
  tmpfs                            252M   0% tmpfs rw   /dev/shm
```

The mounted filesystem section is a combination of information from
`mount` and `df`. This section is skipped if you disable
`--summarize-mounts`{.interpreted-text role="option"}.

``` bash
# Disk Schedulers And Queue Size #############################
        dm-0 | UNREADABLE
        dm-1 | UNREADABLE
         hdc | [cfq] 128
         md0 | UNREADABLE
         sda | [cfq] 128
```

The disk scheduler information is extracted from the */sys* filesystem
in Linux.

``` bash
# Disk Partioning ############################################
Device       Type      Start        End               Size
============ ==== ========== ========== ==================
/dev/sda     Disk                              17179869184
/dev/sda1    Part          1         13           98703360
/dev/sda2    Part         14       2088        17059230720
```

Information about disk partitioning comes from `fdisk -l`.

``` bash
# Kernel Inode State #########################################
dentry-state | 10697 8559  45 0  0  0
     file-nr | 960   0  50539
    inode-nr | 14059 8139
```

These lines are from the files of the same name in the */proc/sys/fs*
directory on Linux. Read the `proc` man page to learn about the meaning
of these files on your system.

``` bash
# LVM Volumes ################################################
LV       VG         Attr   LSize   Origin Snap% Move Log Copy% Convert
LogVol00 VolGroup00 -wi-ao 269.00G                                      
LogVol01 VolGroup00 -wi-ao   9.75G
```

This section shows the output of `lvs`.

``` bash
# RAID Controller ############################################
  Controller | No RAID controller detected
```

The tool can detect a variety of RAID controllers by examining `lspci`
and `dmesg` information. If the controller software is installed on the
system, in many cases it is able to execute status commands and show a
summary of the RAID controller\'s status and configuration. If your
system is not supported, please file a bug report.

``` bash
# Network Config #############################################
  Controller | Intel Corporation 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller
 FIN Timeout | 60
  Port Range | 61000
```

The network controllers attached to the system are detected from
`lspci`. The TCP/IP protocol configuration parameters are extracted from
`sysctl`. You can skip this section by disabling the
`--summarize-network`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option.

``` bash
# Interface Statistics #######################################
interface rx_bytes rx_packets rx_errors tx_bytes tx_packets tx_errors
========= ======== ========== ========= ======== ========== =========
lo        60000000      12500         0 60000000      12500         0
eth0      15000000      80000         0  1500000      10000         0

```

Interface statistics are gathered from `ip -s link` and are
fuzzy-rounded. The columns are received and transmitted bytes, packets,
and errors. You can skip this section by disabling the
`--summarize-network`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option.

``` bash
# Network Connections ########################################
  Connections from remote IP addresses
    127.0.0.1           2
  Connections to local IP addresses
    127.0.0.1           2
  Connections to top 10 local ports
    38346               1
    60875               1
  States of connections
    ESTABLISHED         5
    LISTEN              8
```

This section shows a summary of network connections, retrieved from
`netstat` and \"fuzzy-rounded\" to make them easier to compare when the
numbers grow large. There are two sub-sections showing how many
connections there are per origin and destination IP address, and a
sub-section showing the count of ports in use. The section ends with the
count of the network connections\' states. You can skip this section by
disabling the `--summarize-network`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
option.

This section shows the first few lines of `top` so that you can see what
processes are actively using CPU time. The notable processes include the
SSH daemon and any process whose out-of-memory-killer priority is set to
17. You can skip this section by disabling the
`--summarize-processes`{.interpreted-text role="option"} option.
