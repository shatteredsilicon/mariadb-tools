:program:`mariadb-database-summary`
===================================

NAME
====

:program:`mariadb-database-summary` - Summarize MariaDB information nicely.

SYNOPSIS
========

Usage
-----

::

  mariadb-database-summary [OPTIONS]

:program:`mariadb-database-summary` conveniently summarizes the status and configuration of a
MariaDB database server so that you can learn about it at a glance.  It is not
a tuning tool or diagnosis tool.  It produces a report that is easy to diff
and can be pasted into emails without losing the formatting.  It should work
well on any modern UNIX systems.

RISKS
=====

:program:`mariadb-database-summary` is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Review the tool's known "BUGS"

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-database-summary` works by connecting to a MariaDB database server and querying
it for status and configuration information.  It saves these bits of data
into files in a temporary directory, and then formats them neatly with awk
and other scripting languages.

To use, simply execute it.  Optionally add a double dash and then the same
command-line options you would use to connect to MariaDB, such as the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   mariadb-database-summary --user=root

The tool interacts minimally with the server upon which it runs.  It assumes
that you'll run it on the same server you're inspecting, and therefore it
assumes that it will be able to find the my.cnf configuration file, for example.
However, it should degrade gracefully if this is not the case.  Note, however,
that its output does not indicate which information comes from the MariaDB
database and which comes from the host operating system, so it is possible for
confusing output to be generated if you run the tool on one server and connect
to a MariaDB database server running on another server.

OUTPUT
======

Many of the outputs from this tool are deliberately rounded to show their
magnitude but not the exact detail.  This is called fuzzy-rounding. The idea
is that it does not matter whether a server is running 918 queries per second
or 921 queries per second; such a small variation is insignificant, and only
makes the output hard to compare to other servers.  Fuzzy-rounding rounds in
larger increments as the input grows.  It begins by rounding to the nearest 5,
then the nearest 10, nearest 25, and then repeats by a factor of 10 larger
(50, 100, 250), and so on, as the input grows.

The following is a sample of the report that the tool produces:

.. code-block:: bash

   # MariaDB Server Summary Report ##############################
                 System time | 2012-03-30 18:46:05 UTC

     12346 /tmp/12346/data            0    0   /tmp/12346.sock
     12347 /tmp/12347/data            0    0   /tmp/12347.sock

The first two sections show which server the report was generated on and which
MariaDB instances are running on the server. This is detected from the output of
``ps`` and does not always detect all instances and parameters, but often works
well.  From this point forward, the report will be focused on a single MariaDB
instance, although several instances may appear in the above paragraph.

.. code-block:: bash

This section is a quick summary of the MariaDB instance: version, uptime, and
other very basic parameters. The Time output is generated from the MariaDB server,
unlike the system date and time printed earlier, so you can see whether the
database and operating system times match.

This section is a summary of the output from SHOW PROCESSLIST. Each sub-section
is aggregated by a different item, which is shown as the first column heading.
When summarized by Command, every row in SHOW PROCESSLIST is included, but
otherwise, rows whose Command is Sleep are excluded from the SUM and MAX
columns, so they do not skew the numbers too much. In the example shown, the
server is idle except for this tool itself, and one connected replica, which
is executing Binlog Dump.

The columns are the number of rows included, the number that are not in Sleep
status, the sum of the Time column, and the maximum Time column. The numbers are
fuzzy-rounded.

This section shows selected counters from two snapshots of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS,
gathered approximately 10 seconds apart and fuzzy-rounded. It includes only
items that are incrementing counters; it does not include absolute numbers such
as the Threads_running status variable, which represents a current value, rather
than an accumulated number over time.

The first column is the variable name, and the second column is the counter from
the first snapshot divided by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day), so you can
see the magnitude of the counter's change per day. 86400 fuzzy-rounds to 90000,
so the Uptime counter should always be about 90000.

The third column is the value from the first snapshot, divided by Uptime and
then fuzzy-rounded, so it represents approximately how quickly the counter is
growing per-second over the uptime of the server.

The third column is the incremental difference from the first and second
snapshot, divided by the difference in uptime and then fuzzy-rounded. Therefore,
it shows how quickly the counter is growing per second at the time the report
was generated.

If you specify :option:`--databases` or :option:`--all-databases`, the tool will print
the above section. This summarizes the number and type of objects in the
databases. It is generated by running ``mariadb-dump --no-data``, not by querying
the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, which can freeze a busy server.

The first sub-report in the section is the count of objects by type in each
database: tables, views, and so on. The second one shows how many tables use
various storage engines in each database. The third sub-report shows the number
of each type of indexes in each database.

The last section shows the number of columns of various data types in each
database. For compact display, the column headers are formatted vertically, so
you need to read downwards from the top. In this example, the first column is
``char`` and the second column is ``timestamp``. This example is truncated so it
does not wrap on a terminal.

All of the numbers in this portion of the output are exact, not fuzzy-rounded.

This section shows a pretty-printed version of the my.cnf file, with comments
removed and with whitespace added to align things for easy reading. The tool
tries to detect the my.cnf file by looking at the output of ps, and if it does
not find the location of the file there, it tries common locations until it
finds a file. Note that this file might not actually correspond with the server
from which the report was generated. This can happen when the tool isn't run on
the same server it's reporting on, or when detecting the location of the
configuration file fails.
