SYNOPSIS

  mariadb-status-diff [OPTIONS] -- COMMAND

:program:`mariadb-status-diff` columnizes repeated output from a program like mariadb-admin extended.

RISKS
=====

pt-mext is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Review the tool's known "BUGS"

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-status-diff` executes the ``COMMAND`` you specify, and reads through the result one
line at a time.  It places each line into a temporary file.  When it finds a
blank line, it assumes that a new sample of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS is starting,
and it creates a new temporary file.  At the end of this process, it has a
number of temporary files.  It joins the temporary files together side-by-side
and prints the result.  If :option:`--relative` option is given, it first subtracts
each sample from the one after it before printing results.

OPTIONS
=======

.. option:: --help

.. option:: --relative

 short form: -r

.. option:: --version

 Show version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

This tool does not use any environment variables.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

This tool requires the Bourne shell (*/bin/sh*) and the seq program.
